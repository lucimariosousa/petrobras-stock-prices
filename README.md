# Predicting the stock prices of Petrobras with DeepAR from Amazon AWS
In this project we use the DeepAR forecasting algorithm from Amazon AWS to predict the prices of the stocks of Petrobras. The dataset was stored in a bucket in the S3 service from AWS, and the model was developed in the SageMaker studio. In the figures below we can see the results. The first image shows the time series separated in a trainng (orange) a testing (blue) part. The second image shows the results of the predecitions using the DeepAR algorithm.
